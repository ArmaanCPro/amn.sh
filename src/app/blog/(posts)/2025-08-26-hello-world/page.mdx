# Hello World!

I'm not a web developer, and this blog site itself is heavily inspired by others, and may be _slightly_ broken.
But, I do hope that the content here will end up being useful to `someone`. By the way, this is open-source on Github.

## The Process

Wow, the process of getting this site up and running was insane. I have a _little_ experience with web dev; see my portfolio site I created long before this.
But, the portfolio app was far simpler, and I bootstrapped it with V0, which essentially created all the code for it, and I made minimal changes. It's a single page app, so that's not surprising.
This site was far more complicated. Well, not far more, but I had a few things I wanted to accomplish with this.
- High performance
- Very easy DX for creating new blog pages
- Security

### Performance

The way to a C++ developer's heart is performance. One word is all it takes. Anyway, slow websites are painfully common in today's internet.
Initially, I assumed --- like many others --- that poor performance was the result of heavy Javascript frameworks.
But, this is built with Next.js, so clearly that isn't true. 

It's true for essentially every medium out there that poor performance is the product of **poor development**.
You know, people complain everywhere about poor performance. See complaints about UE5 (don't get me started on this), IDEs, etc.
I ended up choosing Next because of its ease of development, ecosystem, and deployment (with Vercel). This also ends up fulfilling the
security requirement, as Vercel pretty much handles stuff like botting itself (though other platforms like Netlify, Cloudfare Pages, etc do too).
Next.js also has other convenient features like it's app router that greatly simplifies blog post routing.

#### Security

On the topic of security, it ended up being clear that security really isn't a problem. This site has no real way to be exploited (yes, that is a `challenge`),
as there is no server-side code (at least when I created this post), no databases, etc. But, a lesson I learned from writing C++ code was that one of the best ways to avoid
problematic and unsafe code is to write code that conforms to certain guidelines or best practices. For developing in React, it was clear that using Typescript and
static analysis were going to be best practices, at least the most basic ones that I could use without spending a month learning JS/TS.

### DX For Creating Blog Posts

This is was the **hardest** part. I had a vision that I just wanted to be able to write Markdown files, and push those to Github, and Vercel would automatically redeploy and those
files would be automatically added to the site.

That was a naive mindset, but, that simplistic goal greatly helped developed a simple DX.

I ended up choosing `mdx` for each blog page, as it is more flexible than Markdown and fits nicely with stuff like syntax highlighting.

#### Syntax highlighting

I wasted a good few hours on the topic of syntax highlighting. I first chose to use _Bright_, as it seemed like a simple enough tool to get started with highlighting.
I already had remark installed and was using `@next/mdx` and `mdx-js`. They fit nicely with the remark/rehype ecosystem. I'm not actually using `remark` for parsing,
I'm using mdx-js for that. Anyway, I searched around for some good syntax highlighters that worked nicely with rehype.

I first landed on `shikijs` alongside `@shikijs/rehype`, which seemed perfect. This is the syntax highlighter that VS Code uses, and, though a little bit of a heavy package,
seemed worthwile for my site. So, I ended up installing it and changing up all my code to work with it. It wasn't a lot of code chnge particularly, but there were a lot of 
CSS styles I added. It didn't work. Why, you may ask? It's because Turbopack needs rehype plugins to be serializable at build time, which shikijs/rehype wasn't.

So, after wasting an hour of work, I decided to try `rehype-prism-plus`, another popular rehype-based syntax highlighter. Same exact story. I actually checked with ChatGPT
that rehype-prism-plus was serializable and worked with Turbopack, which it confirmed it did. Never trust LLMs.

So, then I decided to try `rehype-pretty-code`, a syntax highlighter focused on nice-looking code. It is based on Shikijs, which meant it had Shiki's robustness.
Also, it was explicitly made for Turbopack and Rehype, or at least, that's what ChatGPT said (lesson _not_ learned). Same story.
Actually, rehype-pretty-code had a Github page that I found with an example using Nextjs and Turbopack, but I tried and couldn't get it to work.

Then, I decided to try `sugar-high` by Vercel, made to be used with Remark. This actually wasn't a great fit, because, as far as I know, it is meant to be used at the MDX parsing stage rather than
at the HTML stage (use with remark rather than rehype). Anyway, this didn't work either.

So after multiple hours of work wasted, I settled on `Bright` which I was using in the first place. I would like to try to get some other syntax highlighter working in the future,
something more powerful, but I do want to use Turbopack.

## What I Learned

Coming into this, I thought React would be pretty easy, as it is pretty easy to visualize with an Object-Oriented perspective with composition.
**However**, that was far frome true. I struggled most with just understanding what the execution flow was, as it is far harder to trace code flow compared to a lower level language.


Also, Javascript and even Typescript have so many akward decisions. I'm not quite sure how to explain it other than just that types don't feel like _types_.
I'm very happy to return to C++ land after this.

## Looking Forward

I expect this website to have various topics, but mostly centered around what I am learning or doing, which is usually _not_ web dev, though I'd be open to more web dev in the future.
I know this post isn't really an informative or useful post, but I did want to outline the process of building this website.




Here's some C++
```c++
#include <print>;
int main()
{
    std::println("Hello, World!");
}
```
