## Why Even Use Windows?

In a lot of professional software development, you'll be using Windows.
Fields like Game Development and Graphics Programming are the most prominent examples, but many SWE companies or teams just use Windows.
I too enjoy using **Linux**. I have Arch & Hyprland installed on my laptop, and Neovim is my preferred editor.

However, my main workstation is a Windows 11 desktop computer I built myself. I know I'm talking extensively about myself, but I feel
my own experience is fairly common among many of you. I do gaming on Windows, development on Windows, and most other tasks I do on Windows.

### The Main Pain Points

I hear a lot of people say "Just use WSL" especially for tools like Git, Node, etc. But, for our case, we won't be using WSL or anything other than native Windows 11.
Yes, that includes MingW (a toolchain I used to use a lot).

On the topic of Git, I don't use Git Bash or any other special git client.

#### Git

I've simply just installed Git from the website and use it from Windows Terminal.
In Windows Terminal, I use _PowerShell_ (the new version).
Git works perfectly fine for me. It really is that simple.
Actually, I'd recommend using a package manager like **chocolatey** or **winget** to install Git.


#### Package Managers

I use both chocolatey and winget for package management. To be honest, winget is excellent. It has come a long way since I first checked it out.
Both Winget and Chocolatey have a **lot** of packages. However, I prefer chocolatey for one specific reason:
It doesn't automatically configure itself with programs you installed using other installers.
Winget will pick up installed programs on your machine regardless of how you installed them. This is a huge disadvantage for me.
I don't want or need Winget to update Epic Games Launcher or Steam whenever I run `winget upgrade`.
Though, that _could_ be a benefit for you.

There are also package managers like **scoop** which I've heard good things about. I've never used it, though, so I can't speak to its specifics.
It seems that scoop can install programs without Admin privileges, which may be good for people on work computers.

### C/C++ Development

C/C++ development is often something people mention as being **terrible** on Windows.
I'm happy to inform you that that isn't true.

For any development workflow, make sure you install the latest version of Visual Studio.
Not just for the IDE, but for all the tools it includes, like MSVC.
You don't need to install CMake, Node, Python, etc. from it. I installed all of those separately.

I use **CMake** for the vast majority of my C/C++ projects.
Normally, I use CLion, but I'm going to cover just Visual Studio for now (as most jobs that require Windows require Visual Studio).

Visual Studio _can_ work well with CMake. But, don't be afraid to use Visual Studio .sln files if your entire team is using Visual Studio.

With CMake, you don't even have to use the `Visual Studio 17 2022` generator.
You can use `Ninja` as your generator, and just use MSVC (cl.exe) as the compiler.
Make sure you add cl.exe to your PATH.
In fact, the PATH is such an important part of your development environment that I recommend you add a lot of your tools to your PATH. Also understand _what_ the PATH _is_.

For compiling since C/C++ files, you can still use cl.exe. For some reason, the Visual Studio Code docs recommend using MingW for development.
However, you can use cl.exe in your terminal for compiling single files.
I usually do something like this:

```Powershell
cl /EHsc /std:c++latest main.cpp /Fe:main.exe
```

However, if you can, you can also use MingW and gcc/clang for compiling single files.

### MingW vs MSVC

To preface, if you're using MingW, use either the Clang64 or UCRT64 toolchains, not the MINGW64 toolchain.

The reason I don't use MingW anymore is that the compilation speed is incredibly slow. On my machine, the performance list goes like this:

(fastest) MSVC with Ninja -> MSVC with .sln -> MingW with Ninja -> MingW with MingW Makefiles (slowest).

MSVC, even with .sln, is around 40-50% faster than MingW in my own game engine project (moon engine).
Now, as a compiler, is MSVC better than gcc or clang?
It's comparable, but I do prefer gcc. I don't really use clang.
But MSVC is still **good**. It is not bad at all. My only slight annoyance is that it's errors and warnings are usually less strict than gcc/clang.
So, when I use something like all warnings and warnings as errors, code that compiles with MSVC may fail with gcc/clang.

### Vim on Windows???

Firstly, I use Neovim on Linux. The only time I **ever** use Vim is when I'm SSH-ed on to a remote server that only has Vim installed.

It's not feasible to use Neovim on Windows. Vim with plugins probably isn't reasonable either (haven't extensively tested though).
Now, is it possible? Yes. But it doesn't work well. Many plugins are flat-out broken on Windows.
Aside from the plugin issue, the Neovim workflow on Windows just isn't that good.
Windows just isn't that good for terminal-based workflows. You can make it work, sure, but if you have _any_ Windows-only tooling,
you're probably out of luck. For example, .sln files, just don't work with Neovim (no plugins I've found).

However, as I mentioned earlier, I use CLion for C/C++ development.
All Jetbrains IDEs have a plugin called `IdeaVim` which works very well. It uses .vimrc, not lua like Neovim, but its functionality is exceptional.
Check out my [IdeaVim .vimrc](https://gist.github.com/ArmaanCPro/59d559ba1587a510ae59603e212ff16c).

Even with Visual Studio, there are Vim emulator plugins like `VsVim` that work decently well.
For VS Code, there are Vim and Neovim extensions, but I think the Vim extension works the best.

For me, I do have a heavily customized [neovim config](https://github.com/ArmaanCPro/nvim-config).
However, .vimrc based vim emulators work well. For me, them most important thing is just basic vim motions.

### Other Programming Languages

If you use package managers, chances are there is little you'll have to do aside from just `choco install <package>`.
Even something like rustup is installable through the terminal.

The most common complaint of things just not working on Windows or requiring extensive customization _just isn't true_ for 99% of things these days.
Just remember to have Visual Studio installed. It fixes a lot of problems with prereqs not being installed, or `redists` not being installed.

## Conclusion

Don't fall down rabbit holes trying to make Windows just like Linux or some _perfect_ platform.
Sure, you may have to find Windows-specific solutions, but they often work well.
Nor does that prevent you from writing cross-platform software, or make you reliant on Windows.
But remember that Windows is not perfect, but it is possible to do most things on it.

A lot of niche Linux commands may not have direct equivalents on Windows, but you can probably install cli tools that achieve those results.
i.e., fzf, fd, etc.
Even if you can't, you can still use WSL. Of course, I tried to make everything in this article as Windows-only as possible, but sometimes you need those tools.

Windows-specific tools usually work better than trying to force Linux tools into Windows, as shown with C/C++ development.

I've been using both Windows and Linux for a long time. You can get very efficient with **both**.
